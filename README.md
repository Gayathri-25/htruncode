We have executed our code by giving 5 vertices as input and their connected edges by 1's and 0's
Here is the respective output:

Number of colours is required to be provided for colouring and it starts colouring with different colours for adjacent edges.

Then here the output is the maximum colours we require for our graph colouring is 3 and the sequence of the graph with their respective colour code is given.

Usage: By running the simulations,the researchers can easily point out the possible causes of faults in the network on the failure in communication between the nodes.
